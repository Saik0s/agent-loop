description: "The propose-solutions command."
---

Generates and compares distinct, viable solutions for a given problem, each with pros and cons, and provides a final recommendation.

**Usage**: `/propose-solutions "<problem statement>"`

## Process:
1.  **Analyze Problem Statement**: Deconstruct the problem to understand its core constraints, goals, and context.
2.  **Generate Distinct Solutions**: Brainstorm and outline 2-3 genuinely different approaches to solving the problem, representing meaningful trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. cost, simplicity vs. scalability).
3.  **Detail Each Solution**: For each solution, provide:
    *   **Approach**: A brief summary of the implementation strategy.
    *   **Pros**: A bulleted list of 2-3 key advantages.
    *   **Cons**: A bulleted list of 2-3 key disadvantages or trade-offs.
4.  **Provide Recommendation**: After presenting the options, conclude with a single, clear recommendation and justify why it's the best choice for the given context.

## Zen Tools Review:
- Use Zen Tools at every stage to double review your approach to ensure that you didn't miss anything.
- Always use zen tools before writing your implementation.

## Examples:
-   `/propose-solutions "Select a backend architecture for a new social media application"`

## Notes:
-   This command is for making informed architectural or technical decisions.
-   All proposed solutions should be viable contenders.
