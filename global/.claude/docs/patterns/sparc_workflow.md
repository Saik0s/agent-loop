# SPARC Methodology Workflow

| Stage | Description | Key Actions | Commands |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Specification** | Define the problem and requirements | - Gather requirements<br>- Write user stories<br>- Define acceptance criteria | `/spec` |
| **Pseudocode** | Plan the solution approach | - Outline algorithm<br>- Identify components<br>- Plan data flow | `think hard` |
| **Architecture** | Design system structure | - Choose patterns<br>- Design APIs<br>- Plan integrations | `/analyze` |
| **Refinement** | Implement and iterate | - Write code<br>- Run tests<br>- Apply feedback | `/build` |
| **Completion** | Finalize and deploy | - Final review<br>- Documentation<br>- Deployment | `/review` |

## Best Practices
- Don't skip Specification - unclear requirements lead to rework
- Keep Pseudocode high-level - avoid implementation details
- Architecture should be "just enough" - don't overdesign
- Refinement is iterative - small changes, frequent validation
- Completion includes knowledge transfer - document decisions
