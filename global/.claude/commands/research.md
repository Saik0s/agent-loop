Conducts comprehensive research on a given topic and provides a structured report.

**Usage**: `/research "<topic>"`

## Process:
1.  **Decompose Topic**: Break down the main topic into 3-5 specific, answerable sub-questions.
2.  **Execute Search Strategy**: Use the "Broad-to-Narrow" search strategy.
    *   Start with broad, two-word queries.
    *   Scan results to identify 3 focus areas.
    *   Draft and execute narrow queries for each area.
    *   Repeat until answer quality stops improving.
3.  **Evaluate Sources**: Assess sources for authority, recency, and bias. Prioritize primary sources.
4.  **Synthesize Findings**: For each sub-question, synthesize information from multiple sources into a coherent answer. Use inline citations.
5.  **Generate Final Report**: Assemble answers into a structured report with a summary, detailed findings, and a list of sources.
6.  **Identify Gaps**: Conclude by listing open questions and recommending next steps.
