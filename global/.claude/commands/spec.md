Creates a detailed feature specification document, including user stories, acceptance criteria, technical requirements, and success metrics.

**Usage**: `/spec "<feature description>"`

## Process:
1.  **User Story**: Define the feature from a user's perspective (`As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [benefit]`).
2.  **Acceptance Criteria**: List specific, testable conditions for success (`Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]`).
3.  **Technical Requirements**: Detail necessary API endpoints, data model changes, business logic, and integrations.
4.  **Edge Cases & Error Handling**: Consider invalid inputs, network failures, and security issues.
5.  **Success Metrics**: Define how to measure the feature's success (e.g., performance targets, user adoption).

## Examples:
- `/spec "A user profile page where users can edit their display name and avatar"`

## Notes:
- This command helps align product and engineering teams by creating a clear, shared understanding of a feature.
- The output is a formal specification document.
