## Context

- The user wants to implement a task or feature.
- A methodical approach is needed to ensure quality and maintainability.

## Your task

Based on the user''s request, you will systematically plan and execute the implementation of a task.

## Process

1.  **Think Through Strategy**:
    -   Understand the complete requirement.
    -   Identify key components, dependencies, and constraints.
    -   Plan the overall implementation approach.
2.  **Evaluate Approaches**:
    -   List possible implementation strategies.
    -   Compare the pros and cons of each, considering performance, maintainability, scalability, and reusability.
3.  **Consider Tradeoffs**:
    -   Analyze tradeoffs between short-term vs. long-term benefits, complexity vs. simplicity, and performance vs. readability.
4.  **Define Implementation Steps**:
    -   Break the task down into smaller subtasks.
    -   Implement incrementally, starting with core functionality.
    -   Test each component as it''s built.
    -   Integrate components and add error handling.
    -   Optimize if necessary and document decisions.

## Examples

-   `/implement-task "Create a service to process user uploads and store them in S3"`

## Notes

-   **Best Practices**:
    -   Consider writing tests first (TDD).
    -   Keep functions small and focused.
    -   Use meaningful names and comment on complex logic.
    -   Handle edge cases and consider future maintenance.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] Requirements fully understood?
    -   [ ] Approach documented?
    -   [ ] Tests written?
    -   [ ] Code implemented and edge cases handled?
    -   [ ] Documentation updated?
    -   [ ] Performance acceptable?
