## Context

- The user wants to set up or check the monitoring of an application.

## Your Task

Based on the user's request, you will set up or check the logging, metrics, alerts, and observability for the application.

## Process

1.  **Assess Needs**: Determine what needs monitoring (errors, performance, usage).
2.  **Implement Logging**: Add structured logging at key points.
3.  **Set Up Metrics**: Configure performance and business metrics.
4.  **Create Alerts**: Define thresholds and notification rules.
5.  **Build Dashboards**: Create visualizations for monitoring.

## Examples

-   `/monitor setup application`
-   `/monitor setup infrastructure`
-   `/monitor check api-health`
-   `/monitor alerts performance`

## Notes

-   Log at appropriate levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO).
-   Avoid logging sensitive data.
-   Set meaningful alert thresholds.
-   Include context in log messages.
